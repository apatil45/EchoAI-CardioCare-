# CardioCare: Cardiovascular Anomaly Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect cardiovascular anomalies. It applies algorithms like CART, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and CNN to classify data, with preprocessing steps such as normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction. The goal is to find the best model for early diagnosis and treatment.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.
- **Machine Learning Models:** CART, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate and compare model performance for anomaly detection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apatil45/CardioCare.git
